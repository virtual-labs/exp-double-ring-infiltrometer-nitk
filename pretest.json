      "question": "Infiltration rate is always",
      "answers": {
        "a": "more than the infiltration capacity",
        "b": "less than the infiltration capacity",
        "c": "equal to or less than the infiltration capacity",
        "d": "equal to or more than the infiltration capacity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "infiltration rate is not more than the infiltration capacity.",
        "b": "infiltration rate is not less than the infiltration capacity.",
        "c": "infiltration rate is equal to or  less than the infiltration capacity. Infiltration capacity is the maximum rate at which the soil observes the water in a given period of time. Hence it is higher than the infiltration rate.",
        "d": "infiltration rate is not equal to or more than  the infiltration capacity."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Transpiration is loss of water from plant leaves.",
        "b": "The entry of water from the soil surface into ground is called infiltration.",
        "c": "The further movement of water into subsurface soil is called percolation.",
